# EMSAS-RT: Easy-Multi-tasking SAS's Real-Time Operating System

### Welcome to EMSAS-RT!

EMSAS-RT is a lightweight and beginner-friendly Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) designed specifically for Arduino platforms. Whether you're working on embedded systems, IoT projects, or complex multitasking tasks, EMSAS-RT simplifies the integration of RTOS concepts into your projects with ease.

## Why EMSAS-RT?

As an engineering student, I noticed that while many students use Arduino boards for their projects, very few venture into using an RTOS. Why? Because the learning curve for RTOS is steep, making it difficult for beginners to get started. I experienced this firsthand during my early projects and found myself struggling to grasp the complexities of traditional RTOS systems.

EMSAS-RT was born from the desire to change that. I wanted to create an RTOS that beginners could easily learn, use, and integrate into their Arduino projects, so they could unlock the potential of real-time systems without the usual barriers.

This project aims to provide **an easy-to-use, intuitive RTOS for Arduino**, making it possible to create more advanced, reliable, and real-time applications in your projects.

## Key Features

- **Multitasking**: Create and manage multiple tasks with minimal overhead.
- **Binary and Counting Semaphores**: Synchronize tasks and control access to shared resources.
- **Mutexes**: Ensure safe access to critical sections of your code.
- **Mailboxes**: Exchange messages between tasks with an easy-to-use message-passing mechanism.
- **Event Groups**: Synchronize multiple tasks using event flags.
- **Round-Robin Scheduling**: Efficient task scheduling for time-critical applications.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to fit within the resource constraints of Arduino platforms.

## Why I Built EMSAS-RT

I'm **Atharva Sasane**, a student pursuing my Bachelor's in Technology. I built EMSAS-RT to make RTOS concepts more accessible to Arduino users, especially beginners. My own struggles with learning RTOS inspired me to create a system that others could use without the steep learning curve I encountered.

By simplifying the integration of RTOS into Arduino projects, I hope to enable more students and hobbyists to create **better, more reliable, and feature-rich projects**.
